## About Me

My name is Aishani Dutta and I am a rising junior ('23) studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My email address is adutta7@illinois.edu

## About My Mentor

This summer I have the privilege of being mentored by [Professor Ling Ren](https://sites.google.com/view/renling) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Professor Ren is researches problems related to applied cryptography, computer security, and distributed algorithms at UIUC's Computer Science Deparment. His website can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/renling).

## About My Project

I am working to implement a protocol for asynchronous data replication (ADR). The goal of an ADR protocol is to ensure that every honest node in a network with $n$ total nodes and $t$ malicious nodes outputs some data message $M$ given that $n >= 3t + 1$ and $t+1$ honest nodes initially contain $M$. The ADR protocol I will be working with this summer has a theoretical improvement over the best known complexity for an ADR protocol under the same constraints. There are three phases within this protocol: encoding, dispersal, and reconstruction. In implementing each phase, I will be working to optimize the performance of the ADR protocol when used in practice.
