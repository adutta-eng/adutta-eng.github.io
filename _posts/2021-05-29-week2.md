## May 24-28 ##

I spent this week mostly understanding the purpose of the ADR/ADD protocol the steps involved in the algorithm I was to simulate. The goal of an ADR protocol is to ensure that every honest node in a network with $n$ total nodes and $t$ malicious nodes outputs some data message $M$ given that $n >= 3t + 1$ and $t+1$ honest nodes initially contain $M$. The ADR protocol I will be working with this summer has a theoretical improvement over the best known complexity for an ADR protocol under the same constraints. There are three phases within this protocol: encoding, dispersal, and reconstruction. In implementing each phase, I will be working to optimize the performance of the ADR protocol when used in practice.

In addition, I attended an introductory event hosted by the Illinois CS REU which introduced participants to the fundamentals of doing research and working with a mentor.
