## June 28 - July 2 ##
Now that I was relatively familiar with the GoLang Interface, I was able to run the encoder/decoder software in the klauspost library and obtain the results as shown. Similar to HoneyBadgerMPC I obtained the times for 1000 iterations comparing various dimensions of message data to be encoded and reconstructed. Due to the Galois field size used as a primitive in the library, we were constrained by the sizes of input data that could be encoded by the library functions. Upon comparing results between the libraries for the small sizes of data we were able to test, it appeared that the Klauspost Go library showed better results (faster time).
