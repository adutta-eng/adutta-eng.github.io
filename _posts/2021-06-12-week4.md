## June 7 - June 11 ##

This week I focused on benchmarking the performance of the Reed Solomon encoder/decoder program within the HoneyBadgerMPC library. (https://github.com/initc3/HoneyBadgerMPC) This library. I wrote a benchmarking program to generate random message strings of varying length (256, 512, 1024, 2048 bits). I attempted to run 1000 iterations of Reed Solomon encoding and decoding for each of the messages I randomly generated and calculate the time needed on average for each iteration. I encountered several difficulties with the library interface and its various functions, that I worked to debug in the following week.
