## July 5 - July 9 ##
Having tested the libraries and gauged the performance of each, I now focused on implementing the ADD/ADR protocol in Go. The algorithm has 3 phases (encoding, dispersal, reconstruction) as well as a setup for generating the data amongst nodes in the network. While working to implement the protocol we realized that the Reed Solomon libraries I had been working to benchmark did not accept input and output data in a desired format. I focused on implementing the other steps in the algorithm while looking into a different library for RS encoding (https://github.com/vivint/infectious). Some of my code is pictured below.
