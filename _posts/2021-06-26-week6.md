## June 21-25 ##
My next goal was to benchmark the performance of the Klauspost Reed Solomon encoding/decoding library (https://github.com/klauspost/reedsolomon). The library was written in Go, a language that I have never worked with, so I ended up spending a large portion of the week setting up Go and working through some tutorials to familiarize myself with the syntax and basic functionality of the language. Afterwards I began wworking to modify some of the existing test cases present in the library documentation to obtain input data that was similar to the benchmarking I did for the HoneyBadgerMPC library.
