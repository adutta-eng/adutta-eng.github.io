## May 17-21 ##
I met with my mentor to discuss the various projects going on in his lab. I learned about the various projects that Professor Ren is working on such as a private information retrieval protocol and optimized constructions of depth-robust graphs. Based on my prior experiences and the time frame of the DREU program we decided it would be best for me to work on SPURT, a randomness beacon project focused on decentralized random number generation. More specifically, I learned about the asynchronous data replication protocol that would be used in SPURT. I spent the majority of the week reading a couple papers about SPURT and the ADR protocol, and the various components in each project.
