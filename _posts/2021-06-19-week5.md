## June 14-18 ##

After meeting with my mentor and graduate student to better understand how to use the HoneyBadgerMPC library, I was able to obtain the results as shown below: ![results1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55339760/148300192-176eefae-d21b-46bc-b4e2-06a582d9a479.png)

While I was successful in benchmarking one of the encoder and decoder programs present in the library, the results I obtained only gave us a preliminary idea of the library's performance. In particular I ran into issues getting the Galois field library for the optimized HoneyBadgerMPC Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) encoder/decoder to compile with my randomized data. Most likely, we will not continue to probe into the intricacies of the library because the existing code base is primarily written in Go, next week I focus on benchmarking a GoLang library for Reed Solomon encoding/decoding, to gauge whether it has comparable enough performance.
