The first step in the ADR protocol relies on Reed Solomon encoding/decoding. My initial goal for this project was to compare several different libraries which have 
implemented Reed Solomon encoding/decoding and determine which implementation has the most optimal performance. I spent this week trying to understand how Reed Solomon 
encoding/decoding worked, by studying lectures from Professor Ryan O' Donell's CS Theory Toolkit and Professor Mary Wootters' course on Algebraic Error Correcting Codes. 
These resources also exposed me to several interesting concepts in abstract algebra and Galois field theory.

In addition, I attended an introductory event hosted by the Illinois CS REU which introduced participants to the fundamentals of doing research and working with a mentor.
